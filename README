This is a simple RNN model that uses text prediction to generate tweets.

It first scrapes twitter for the top trending hashtags in the US. It generates a data set on them and trains a model.
It will generate tweets in the output folder every once in a while while it is training. 

to run first create a config file named config.py that has your twitter API keys, this is needed to get the trending hashtags.
The config file only needs the following

	TWITTER_APP_KEY =
	TWITTER_APP_KEY_SECRET = 
	TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN = 
	TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET =

To run simply run the tweetgen.py file

it has two modes
	
to collect data run
	python tweetgen.py collect_data

to generate tweets while training the network run
	python tweetgem.py gen_tweets
