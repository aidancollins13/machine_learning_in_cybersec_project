This is a simple RNN model that uses text prediction to generate tweets.

It first scrapes twitter for the top trending hashtags in the US. It generates a data set on them and trains a model.
It will generate tweets in the output folder every once in a while while it is training. 

to run first create a config file named config.py that has your twitter API keys, this is needed to get the trending hashtags.
The config file only needs the following

	TWITTER_APP_KEY =
	TWITTER_APP_KEY_SECRET = 
	TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN = 
	TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET =

to collect data run
	python collect_data.py 

to generate tweets while training the network run
	python tweetgen.py


The scraper i use in collect_data is sometimes problematic, if it doesn't get twets from the hashtag you can provide your own string to get tweets as an argument
